The Final FM is a song liking application that allows a user to login or create an account. From here a user will be able to:
- search for randon songs
- create a list of liked songs
- add a random song or searched for song to their list of liked songs
- delete songs from the individual users list of liked songs
- search for an artist's songs
- search a city to see concerts playing there.
- view the TickerMaster information for a concert

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It can also be accessed on Heroku at https://the-final-fm.herokuapp.com/

## Configuring The App

**API keys needed**

You will need two API keys to get this project working to see the [backend database](https://github.com/AustinBH/The-Final-FM-backend)

*TicketMaster: Free<br>
*Last FM: Free

Once the git repository is forked and cloned, in the project directory, you can run:<br>
**`npm install`**

Once the npm packages are installed run:<br>

**`npm start`**

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
However, if you are running the backend API at the same time you will need to open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser, or specify a specific port for the json server to run on and the app to run on. **They cannot run on the same port**

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
