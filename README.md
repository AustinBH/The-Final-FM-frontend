The Final FM is a song likeing application that allows a user to login or create an account. From here a user will be able to:
- search for randon songs
- create a list of liked songs
- add a random song or searched for song to their list of liked songs
- delete songs from the individual users list of liked songs
- search for an artist's songs
- search a city to see concerts playing there.
 - view the TickerMaster informaiton for a concert

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Configuring The App

**API keys needed**

You will need two API keys to get this project working to see the [backend database](https://github.com/AustinBH/The-Final-FM-backend)

*TicketMaster: free<br>
*Last FM: Free

Once the git repository is forked and cloned, in the project directory, you can run:<br>
**`npm install`**

At this point you will want to make sure that the [backend API](https://github.com/AustinBH/The-Final-FM-backend) is also configured and running.

Once the npm is installed run:<br>

**`npm start`**

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
However, if you are running the backend API at the same time you will need to open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser, or specify a specific port for the json server to run on and the app to run on. **They cannot run on the same port**

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
